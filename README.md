# Welcome

## Install stuff and get the code

We recommend Ubuntu [18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

* Install Ubuntu on your computer or in a virtual machine
* Get a [Github ](https://github.com)account
* Go to [https://github.com/Learn-code-strategies/DEXBot](https://github.com/Learn-code-strategies/DEXBot)
* Create a fork for yourself by pressing the fork button
* Create a suitable directory on your computer for all coding projects and open a terminal in it.
* Clone your own repository by typing `git clone` and the link you get from the green button "clone or download". Then press enter. You should now have a local copy of DEXBot.
* Make a branch for experimenting or making changes: `git branch my-first-experiment´`
* Go into that branch: `git checkout my-first-experiment` . Now feel free to do anything. Everything is easily reversible.´
